# 🚗 YOLO Benchmarking on KITTI Dataset 📊

Welcome to the YOLO Benchmarking project! In this repository, we're on a mission to compare and benchmark YOLO v5, v7, v8, and the latest v9 models 🧠. Using the **KITTI dataset**, we're diving deep into performance metrics, accuracy, and speed to see how each version stacks up in real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Buckle up! 🚀

## 🌟 Objective

The goal of this project is to provide a detailed comparison between **YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and YOLOv9** on the **KITTI dataset**, a widely-used benchmark for computer vision tasks in autonomous vehicles. We'll explore key metrics like:

- **Model Accuracy (mAP) 🏆**
- **Inference Speed (FPS) 🚀**
- **Model Size (Memory Efficiency) 💾**
- **Training Time ⏳**

By the end of this project, you’ll have a clear idea of which YOLO model performs best for your autonomous driving or object detection needs.
